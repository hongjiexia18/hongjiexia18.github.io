I am a fifth-year Ph.D. at Boston University majoring in neurobiology. My research focuses on rats' decision-making, combining large-scale behavioral analysis and in vivo imaging. I am advised by [Dr. Ben Scott](https://www.scottcognitionlab.com/). 
I earned my M.S. in neuroscience at Northwestern University. I was working in Dr. William Klein's lab where I studied the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease, specifically on the relationship between amyloid beta oligomers and phosphorylated Tau in chicken embryos.
I received my B.A. in biology from Boston University.
