I am a fifth-year Ph.D. at Boston University majoring in neurobiology. My research focuses on rats' decision-making, combining large-scale behavioral analysis and in vivo imaging. I am advised by [Dr. Ben Scott](https://www.scottcognitionlab.com/). 
I earned my M.S. in neuroscience at Northwestern University. I was working in Dr. William Klein's lab where I studied the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease, specifically on the relationship between amyloid beta oligomers and phosphorylated Tau in chicken embryos.
I received my B.A. in biology from Boston University.

 <!---  Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->
